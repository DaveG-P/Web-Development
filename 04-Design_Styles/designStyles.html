	<h1 style= "font-family: Helvetica;">Design Styles</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this assignemnt is to showcase websites that use the four design styles dicussed this week. <br>Below you will find 4 websites I found that give the best examples of the design principals listed in the bullet<br> points below. As you can see, the designers were able to use variations of contrast, repetition, alignment, and <br>proximity; some using more of a principal than others.
		I chose each website based on what I percieved as <br> showing one of the design styles. Please click on on the picture to direct you to the respective website page. 

<dl><!--Description List -->
  <dt><b>Contrast</b></dt>
  <dd>- A form of visual communication used to contrast similar elements in one <br> group look similar but different from another group of elements. This is done by using colors, fonts, shapes etc.</dd>
  <dt><b> Repetition </b></dt>
  <dd>- Patterned movement use to create interest and leadinng the eye from one element to the next.</dd>
  <dt><b> Alignment </b></dt>
  <dd>- Used to create hierarchy of importance for the content of the page</dd>
  <dt><b> Proximity </b></dt>
  <dd>- Used to visually group similar items to create a more organized layout. Unrelated items should be <br>placed further apart emphasizing a weak relationship.</dd>

			This SF based branding and design company’s website is a good example of <br>using contrast on their website as well as alignment and repetition. The designers<br> used contrast in terms of color and shape in the following ways to navigate the website.
			<ul> <!--Unordered List -->
				<li>Each element is distinguished by a picture and contrasting colors.</li>
				<li>The importance of an element is distinguished by the shape or size of the element.</li>
				<li>Each of these elements represent a section of  the website such as about the<br>company, culture, career opportunities, projects etc.</li>
				<li>Thus the contrasts [aired with the elements allows  the user to  easily <br>navigate and explore and learn more about the company.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2 style="font-family:Sans-serif;"> <li> Repetition </li> </h2>

			Another Bay Area based company; Dolby, known for its audio technology has<br> a website designed with repetition in mind.  
			<ul><!--Unordered List -->
				<li>Repetition is used consistently throughout the website in the form of<br> spatial relationship, font, size and smooth texture look to create balance and unity.</li>
				<li>The designers applied space, pattern and smooth texture to create a a flowy rhythm to it.</li>
				<li>Dolbys website also uses a pattern of videos at the top of the page followed<br>by rectangle and square boxes with pictures of their work along with<br> companies they have worked with in the past.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2 style="font-family:Sans-serif;"> <li> Alignment</li> </h2>

			One of my all-time favorite websites for data journalism and pop culture.
			<br>The puddings home page is a great example of the alignment principal used.
			<ul><!--Unordered List -->
				<li>Web designers created a hierarchy of grids organizing the website from<br> most important projects down to past projects </li>
				<li>The top grid or box being the biggest with bigger font and at the center<br> of the page indicates an importance.</li>
				<li>Next two recent projects slightly smaller are aligned next to each other <br>underneath the main work.</li>
				<li>Followed by 6 smaller boxes aligned unformly to show past projects based<br> on topic. </li>
				<li>The use of this design principal created a pyramid like hierarchy of <br>information going from recent to previous projects.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2 style="font-family:Sans-serif;"> <li> Proximity </li></h2>

	 		A website created for one of my favorite musicians and artists Toro y Moi. <br>His label and graphic design studio, Company Studio, is a perfect example of <br>proximity use.
			<ul><!--Unordered List -->
				<li>The use of proximity and simplicity of his webiste makes it clear where <br>you are and what your are looking at</li>
				<li>The website uses contrasting colors which change everytime you refresh<br> to organize and distinguish between music studio and graphic design <br>related work.</li>
				<li>The website clearly uses proximity to divide the website into two <br>sections and keeping things related to both sides of the site.</li>
				
			</ul>
