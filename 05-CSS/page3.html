				The Beats were very much influenced by jazz music and musicians. Kerouac would emulate bebop and cool jazz, and like other <br>Beats, wanted his poetry and prose to have a similar musical language, rhythmic feeling and flow to what he heard in modern jazz.<br> The Beats didn’t want Dixieland.

				Who are the jazz musicians who influenced the Beats? I’ll single out a few that I have always liked,<br> who use a similarly oblique musical language to get their musical points across. At the top of the list would be Charlie Parker (aka “Bird”),<br> who reinvented jazz music, established a new harmonic system, and blew everybody’s minds with his improvisations. <br>Kerouac wrote a poem about him titled, what else, “Charlie Parker.” There is Lennie Tristano, who devised a new way of <br>playing piano, adapting Bird’s improvisations to the piano keyboard and influencing generations of other musicians. <br>Saxophonist Warne Marsh was part of the Tristano school, and taught generations of young horn players the new style of blowing.

				Beat literature and bebop/cool jazz were both existential, outside the mainstream. It was in a way like outsider art, and the French understood it. <br>The postwar French left-bank existentialist intellectuals like Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Boris Vian went wild for the new music <br>of Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. Louis Malle’s young hero in the 1971 film Le Souffle du Coeur (Murmur of the Heart) was likewise<br> smitten by the new music of Dizzy Gillespie, Monk, and Charlie Parker. The musicians mentioned here had lots in common with <br>the Beat writers; they felt alienated from the mainstream music fans (who wanted music less opaque and insular as what Monk and Parker<br> were playing) as well as from the racism of the day. Young bebop musicians who got drafted had to fight and maybe get injured/killed <br>in segregated military units, but would return to segregation in the U.S. Miles Davis, returning from a successful Paris stint (and a love <br>affair with Juliette Greco), turned to heroin when facing the rampant racism in America. The Beat poets felt similarly alientated when the <br>Korean War started in 1950 and with the rise of the military-industrial complex, The Cold War and the Republican administration <br>that ruled the country from 1952-1960.
