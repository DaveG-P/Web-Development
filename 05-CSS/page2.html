			<h3>An Introduction to beat poets</h3>
			<!--TO DO@ Make a link to Allen Ginsburgs "Howl" poem --> 
			<p>
				In the 1940s and 50s, a new generation of poets rebelled against the conventions of mainstream American life and writing. <br> They became known as the Beat Poets––a name that evokes weariness, down-and-outness, the beat under a piece of music,<br> and beatific spirituality.  At first, they organized in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. By the 1950s,poets at the <br>heart of the movement had settled in the Bay Area, especially in neighborhoods near Beat poet and publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s<br> bookstore, City Lights.

				By the mid-1950s, the Beats helped to spearhead a cultural vanguard reacting against institutionalized American values, materialism, <br>and conformity. On October 7, 1955, the Beats gave their first major public poetry reading, a seminal event held at Six Gallery in San Francisco. <br> Among the five poets to perform their work was Allen Ginsberg, who first read <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl" target="_blank">"Howl",</a> a poem in the tradition of Walt Whitman<br> that Ginsberg described as “an emotional time bomb that would continue exploding… the military-industrial-nationalistic complex.”
