			<h3>An essay by Jack Kerouac</h3>
			<p>
				Born to die The Beat Generation, made up of writers, artists and misfits, was forged not long after the end of World War II. <br>People wanted change, the old ways and traditions were slowly being neglected and social rules of that time were put into question.<br> The Beat Generation were the ones leading the way in questioning the old rules and regulations not because they wanted to but<br> because America wanted it. The Beat Generation was a bohemian hipster like movement that got its drive and inspiration from<br> sexuality, drugs, booze, crazy people and situations and religions like Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism. <br>The Beat Generation embraced creativity untouched by culture.
