			<p>Here is the first paragraph for the website I am making. I am taking this class as part of a career transition. I am interested in the way human beings interact with technology. Apart from webdesign class I am also taking some foundational courses in software development. In addition to that I plan to take some foundational bussiness classes to help me become a freelancer and entrepreneur. I am extremely excited on the next chapter of my career.
